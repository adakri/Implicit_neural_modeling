# Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Practical at ENSIMAG 3A MMIS 

Authors: A.Vivi√®re and A.Dakri

**NOTE** I have ported most of my school projects (rather hastely) because my gitlab subscription was going to expire and with it evry bit of (some would say poorly written) code I have written. But for nostalgia's sake why not ! (I also find myself more than I want to coming back to bits and pieces of code I used).


This project implements methods for voxel carving using images (and calibration camera matrics) and compare it to implicit modeling techniques using neural networks (MLPs). More details in the project report.
